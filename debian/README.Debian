caret for Debian
----------------

Due to patent issues Debian VTK comes without MPEG2 support. Therefore the MPEG
support in CARET is disabled as well.

CARET is build with MINC support, but at the moment without ITK support. This
will change once the Debian maintainer can determine what advantages building
against ITK provides.
