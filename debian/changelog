caret (5.5~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Initial release. (Closes: #421703)
  * MPEG support is disabled as VTK in Debian does not provide the necessary
    library for patent reasons (see #408552).
  * The package builds internal libraries as shared libs instead of static
    linking to reduce the size of the distributed binaries.
  * A desktop and menu file for Caret5 was added.
  * Caret binaries are called via a wrapper script that sets an appropriate
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the necessary caret-internal libs and some Qt image
    format plugins.
  * Caret depends on the caret-data package that provides tutorials, online
    help and atlas datasets. While these files are part of the binary
    distribution of Caret they are not part of the sources. The Debian
    maintainer packaged them in a separate source package using the binary
    distribution as source (caret-data).

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Uses dh_wraporig to make source tarball DFSG-free
