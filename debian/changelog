caret (5.6~dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjust build-dependencies to account for the new libqt4-opengl-dev
    package, built by qt4-x11 (from 4.4.0-1 on). Done in a backport-friendly
    way, i.e. alternatively depend on libqt4-dev (>= 4.3) and (<< 4.4.0).

caret (5.6~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Do not install link for caret_edit manpage, since the binary is not
    installed by the Debian package.
  * Use minc version 2 instead of old libminc0.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.0 -- no changes necessary.
  * Recommend caret-data package version 5.6 or later.
  * Several bugfixes (missing headers) for GCC 4.3 compatibility.
  * Converted debian/copyright into a machine readable format.

caret (5.5.2~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version. Build-depends on Qt >= 4.3. Merged most commandline
    tools into 'caret_command'.
  * Package now honours DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS setting 'noopt'.
  * Build with debug symbols by default.
  * Debian packaging does not use upstream Makefile wrapper to qmake anymore,
    as it might hide build-failures. Calling qmake from debian/rules directly
    instead.
  * Simplified Debian diff to minimize conflicts between upstream changes and
    Debian packaging.
  * Set linker flags -Wl,--as-needed and --no-undefined to reduce the number
    of package dependencies and ensure proper internal shared libraries.
  * Do not build 'caret_edit' anymore as it caused problems with the internal
    shared libraries. This should be no problem, as it is a very simple
    editor and all of the 1000 editors in Debian should be able to do what
    'caret_edit' does/did.

caret (5.5~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Initial release. (Closes: #421703)
  * MPEG support is disabled as VTK in Debian does not provide the necessary
    library for patent reasons (see #408552).
  * The package builds internal libraries as shared libs instead of static
    linking to reduce the size of the distributed binaries.
  * A desktop and menu file for Caret5 was added.
  * Caret binaries are called via a wrapper script that sets an appropriate
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the necessary caret-internal libs and some Qt image
    format plugins.
  * Caret depends on the caret-data package that provides tutorials, online
    help and atlas datasets. While these files are part of the binary
    distribution of Caret they are not part of the sources. The Debian
    maintainer packaged them in a separate source package using the binary
    distribution as source (caret-data).

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Uses dh_wraporig to make source tarball DFSG-free
