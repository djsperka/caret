Description: Computerized Anatomical Reconstruction and Editing Toolkit
 This software allows for creating, viewing and manipulating surface
 reconstructions of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, viewing volumes and for
 displaying experimental data on the surfaces and volumes. While Caret is
 primarily a GUI application with 'caret_command' there is also a versatile
 command line tool, that allows access to a substantial proportion of Caret's
 functionality.
 .
 Caret can download and use stereotaxic atlases (human, monkey, mouse and rat)
 from an open online database.
