Cifti lib requires the QT toolkit to compile.  The first version of Cifti was written to build with Qt 4.7.1, and it is recommended that you use this, or a later version of QT.

To build the release version on Linux/Unix/OSx, run the following command:
> qmake "CONFIG+=release"
make

To build the debug version, run:
> qmake "CONFIG+=debug"
make

To build on Windows with Visual Studio, run:
> qmake "CONFIG+=vs"
make

To build documentation, run:
> qmake "CONFIG+=doc"
make doc

To build a shared library, add the keyword "dll" to qmake CONFIG, i.e.:
> qmake "CONFIG+=release dll"
make
